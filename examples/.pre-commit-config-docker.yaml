# Example .pre-commit-config.yaml for using Docker-based hooks
# This configuration uses Docker containers instead of requiring local tool installation

# Skip Docker hooks on pre-commit.ci (which doesn't support Docker)

  hooks:
  # Option 1: Use Docker-based hooks (no local tool installation required)
  # These require the pre-commit-terraform-tools Docker image

  - id: terraform_validate_docker
  - id: terraform_docs_docker
  - id: terraform_checkov_docker
  - id: terraform_trivy_docker
  - id: terraform_tflint_docker
  - id: infracost_breakdown_docker  # Requires INFRACOST_API_KEY

  # Option 2: Use traditional script-based hooks (requires local tools)
  # Uncomment these if you have terraform, tflint, etc. installed locally

  # - id: terraform_checkov

# You can also mix both approaches:
# Use Docker hooks for tools you don't have installed locally,
# and script hooks for tools you do have locally

# Docker hooks advantages:
# ✅ No need to install tools locally (terraform, tflint, checkov, etc.)
# ✅ Consistent tool versions across team members
# ✅ Isolated environment prevents dependency conflicts
# ✅ Works on any system with Docker installed

# Docker hooks considerations:
# ⚠️  Requires Docker to be installed and accessible
# ⚠️  Slightly slower due to container startup overhead
# ⚠️  May require proper Docker permissions setup
# ⚠️  Need to ensure Docker image is available (pull or build)

# Build the tools image locally with:
# docker build -f Dockerfile.tools -t ghcr.io/actuarysailor/pre-commit-terraform-tools:latest .

# Or use the pre-built image once published:
# docker pull ghcr.io/actuarysailor/pre-commit-terraform-tools:latest
